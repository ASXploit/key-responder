# key-responder
A Javascript Key Responding class used as an updated yet still simple html5 hackbase. This hackbase wont be visual just used for simple keyhacks, Still needs updates to take in toggling of hacks and such.

# updates
As i am writing this i have just uploaded the first version of the key responder.. All it does for now is just react to key presses like an event listener would(it does use an event listener), My next goal is to update it and have the ability to Toggle hacks..
Once that is done the responder will be done and just need some code cleanup.
